### Hi ðŸ‘‹

Here are some games I've worked on in the last few years. 

## Games

- Screaming Tire (unreleased 2019) - [Code](https://github.com/CGagnier/Screaming-Tires/tree/master)
    - The idea was a car game that you would drive with your voice, we faced some issues with the microphone input and didn't finish it. 3D game made in Godot, with assets created in Blender. 
- **Dive Jam 2** - Into the depth (2019) - [Itch.io](https://dimble.itch.io/into-the-depths) | [Code](https://github.com/CGagnier/divejam2-into-the-depths)
    - Weeklong jam, made all assets, and code (C#) using Unity
- Six Card Golf (2021) - [Itch.io](https://dimble.itch.io/six-card-golf) | [Code](https://github.com/CGagnier/six-card-golf)
    - Clone of a card game I liked playing in 2021. Made it in Lua (Love 2D) with Playdate-like graphics.
- **GGJ 24** - Bored Ghosts (2024) - [Itch.io](https://jere1862.itch.io/bored-ghost) | [Code](https://github.com/jere1862/Overscope2024) 
    - Weekend Jam at Concordia. Worked on characters rigging and some tech fixes. First contact with Unreal engine.
